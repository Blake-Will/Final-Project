    <p> Favorite Class this Semester:</p>
    <p> I think International Trade has been my favorite class this semester. A key takeaway from the class is that
        all countries are better off in free trade (even though some benefit more than others) rather than not trading with 
        other countries. I think the notion that free trade hurts countries is a common misconception, so it was very 
        interesting to learn that.
