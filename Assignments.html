    <p>Assignments:</p>
    
    <p> 1A: Working with binary numbers and writing pseudocode with them. Also practiced using truth table / boolean 
        values </p>
    
    <p> 1B: Wrote functions that iterated and used loops. Also performed various manipulations on lists</p>
    
    <p> 2A: Iterated with selection sort, utilized sequential and binary searches, and calculated time complexity </p>
    
    <p> 2B: Created simulation that calculated an object's position fired into the air, incorporating the variation
        of gravitational acceleration with altitude </p>
    
    <p> 3A: Wrote pseudocode to calculate time complexity for given operations, and worked with recursive fuctions </p>
    
    <p> 3B: Used numpy and boolean logic to try and get water to flow from the top to the bottom of an object, 
        having to tell the functions where and when to flow water </p>
    
    <p> 4: Used object-oriented programming to model a class with a teacher, students, and assignments, where we 
        calculated students' grades and teacher's pay </p>
    
    <p> 5: Finished out our cancer dataset using pandas, seaboard, and scikit, running the dataset and determining
        the beningn and malignant values, their skew, mean, and std dev, plots and heatmaps. </p>
    
    <p> Favorite Assignment:</p>
    <p> The final has been my favorite assignment this semester. I am a financial economics major, and I had no experience
        with programming prior to taking this class. Thus, I found the final to be the most interesting as I have always
        wanted to know how websites are built / how to build one, and I am not very interested / well versed in engineering,
        rendering the majority of the homework assignments a bit difficult for me. </p>
